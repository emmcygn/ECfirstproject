<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
I am an MSc Computer Science Candidate with a Bachelor's Degree in Legal Management. I have a passion for data-driven marketing and strategy, and leveraging my legal background to create value and impact in the tech industry.<br><br>

My most recent role was with Notey Labs, where I worked in Digital Marketing for the Chinafy team. Here I used data analytics to build dashboards that informed my marketing work to drive organic site growth.<br><br>

At Kanine Group, I managed day to day data analysis and operations work, working with various web suites from ERPs, CRMs, vendor databases, and more. I also ran international logistics operations for supply chain and fulfillment through CRMs, 3PLs, and more. I successfully developed and executed key strategies, account generation, account management, and marketing campaigns for the company, using my skills in customer relationship management, communication, and Google Analytics. <br><br>

Previously, I taught quantitative methods and information technology to final year thesis students and their tech startups at Ateneo de Manila University, where I also graduated from. <br><br>

I also worked as a Business Growth Specialist at VIRTRIX, a VR/AR Web3.0 Tech Firm, where I led the rebranding and remarketing of the company, and contributed to the financial valuation modelling in a seed round of investments. <br><br>

I am always looking for new opportunities to learn, grow, and collaborate with others in the tech field.
